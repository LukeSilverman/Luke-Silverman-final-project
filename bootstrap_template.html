                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>The Regents exams are an important component of New York State's educational system for a long time. These tests aim to gauge pupils' comprehension of foundational disciplines including science, arithmetic, and English. In the state, passing these tests requires a high school diploma. The Regents examinations are designed to assess academic performance, but they have also revealed concerning racial differences in student performance.</p>

                <h2>How Educational Inequalities Are Reflected in Regents Exams</h2>
                <p>The graph illustrates the wide variations in graduation rates between 2019 and 2023 among various racial and ethnic groupings. The highest graduation rates were continuously 93% for Asian students and 91% for White students, followed by 81% for Hispanic students and 82% for Black students. Nonetheless, there were glaring differences in the percentage of pupils who passed the Regents tests, which was much lower across all groups. For instance, just 38% of White students passed the Regents, whereas only 29% of Asian students did, despite their high graduation rate. These disparities raise the possibility of systemic problems with the Regents exam itself by implying that many students graduate despite having difficulty on it.</p>

                <h2>Trends in Cohorts and Regents Diplomas</h2>
                <p>The number of students graduating and receiving Regents diplomas in New York State changed significantly between 2001 and 2011. The overall number of Regents diplomas awarded rose sharply between 2001 and 2009, reaching a peak of 255,438 in 2009 from 69,948 in 2001. The increase in total graduates, which went from 115,184 in 2001 to 271,374 in 2009, is reflected in this growth. Nonetheless, the percentage of students who received Regents degrees as a percentage of all graduates increased gradually as well, rising from 4.91% in 2001 to 14.4% in 2008, indicating a stronger focus on the value of Regents degrees during this time.</p>
                <p>It's crucial to consider how much the Regents credential contributed to students' academic achievement despite these increases. Even at its height in 2008, less than 15% of graduates received a Regents diploma throughout a large portion of the early 2000s. This suggests that a sizable majority of students did not meet this particular criterion at graduation. The decline following 2009, which saw the percentage fall to just 5.74% by 2011, highlights how ineffective Regents degrees are as a gauge of academic achievement. According to the findings, most graduates did not view Regents degrees as a differentiator, even though they were marketed as a standard for academic achievement. The likelihood that the Regents certificate was not as important to academic success as previously thought is increased by the fact that the majority of students instead completed their high school education in other ways. This calls into question the accuracy of standardized tests, such as Regents diplomas, in determining a student's preparedness for college or the workforce. </p>

                <h2>Racial Disparities in Graduation Rates</h2>
                <p>The graduation statistics for New York State from 2019 to 2023 show that racial differences in student achievement are still present. Black and Hispanic students trailed behind, with graduation rates of 81% and 82%, respectively, while Asian students graduated at a rate of 93% and White students at a rate of 91%. In other words, compared to less than 10 for Asian and White students, approximately 20 out of every 100 Hispanic or Black students did not graduate on time. Systemic issues like underfunded schools, restricted access to advanced curriculum, and a dearth of services like tutoring and test-taking help are mostly to blame for these disparities.</p>
                <p> Minority-majority schools frequently experience financial issues, which limits the students' chances of success. Since a diploma is required to access postsecondary education and steady employment, these graduation disparities are significant. Closing these gaps and guaranteeing that every student receives the assistance they require to graduate requires addressing the larger disparities in education funding and resources. </p>

                <h2>Broadening the Lens: SAT and ACT Disparities</h2>
                <p>The SAT graph shows how racial success differences continue to exist across the country, while the Regents tests show gaps inside New York. Asian students routinely outperform all other groups on the SAT; their average score was above 1150 between 2017 and 2023. White children perform well as well; they frequently receive scores above 1100. Hispanic and Black pupils, on the other hand, lag well behind, with Hispanic students marginally exceeding 1000 and Black students averaging about 950.</p>
                <p>These disparities imply that privilege, not student aptitude, is frequently reflected in standardized assessments such as the SAT. </p>

                <h2>Significance of These Findings</h2>
                <p>It is evident from data on graduation rates, SAT scores, and Regents tests that standardized testing frequently exacerbates rather than lessens educational disparities. These gaps are caused by a number of variables, including unequal access to high-quality instruction, differences in school budget, and a lack of resources for test preparation. For example, SAT scores are far lower for Black and Hispanic students, who already face challenges with lower graduation rates and Regents pass percentages. My survey's responses confirmed these conclusions, with many emphasizing the necessity of systemic adjustments to guarantee that every kid has the tools they require for success. **(SURVEY RESULTS CAN BE FOUND HERE)**</p>

                <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
                <p>The differences between the SAT, ACT, and Regents are only the beginning. They draw attention to more serious problems with the American educational system. Low-income and mostly minority schools can lack innovative curricula, qualified teachers, and even basic school supplies. Students of color find it considerably more difficult to perform well on standardized examinations as a result of these injustices.</p>
                <p>Standardized examinations will not heal the opportunity gaps; rather, they will continue to reflect them unless attention is directed toward resolving these structural injustices. To ensure that all kids, regardless of their background, receive the resources they need to achieve, policymakers must prioritize establishing an equal foundation for learning. </p>
